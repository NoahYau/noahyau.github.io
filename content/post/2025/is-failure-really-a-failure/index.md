#### This illustrates the discuss of current notions of success and failure among young people. Also, some of my own perspectives and observations.

Have you ever wondered that being a successful person in the view of society is the genuine success? In regard to the question, I am going to discuss about the notion on success and failure among our generation.

In this era, Internet is leading the world, so do our life. We are surrounded by social media, meeting friends online hasn't been that easy. Although communication can be done without seeing each other, the flip side of the coin is that we become more anxious regarding the views, likes of every post, and comments on our beauty. Meanwhile the situation is similar in a popular job nowadays, Key Opinion Leader. Their revenue is hooked by the amount of views of videos they post. Instead of earning lots of money, which is viewed as the indicator of success by our parents and the society, the young generation would consider fame as the indicator of success. For instance, a YouTuber with few million of subscribers, while his channel is introducing some intriguing tech gadgets. Even the salary of this YouTuber is not that high, the young generation will look up to him. The young generation would view being famous as success, rather than salary, also the priority in seeking jobs.

In my point of view, being able to pursue dreams is the indicator of success. Having a unique aspiration is an act of exceptional bravery since it may cost lots of money or you can't gain money from it but you have to put a lot of effort in it. Imagine being a guitarist, you have to practise and practise while you can only receive not much revenue in a performance or show. It is hard to maintain the living, this situation makes a lot of people shrank back at the sight of it. That's why it is brave to pursue dream when you can't really make money from the interest.

When speaking of using fame as the indicator of success, I would say it is not the most precise indicator to define success. If you look at a YouTuber called ISHOWSPEED, although his act on the Internet can entertain the audience, when he went to Hong Kong, fans of ISHOWSPEED went insane and they blocked the main streets. Even though the fans of him caused many disturbance to the resident around, ISHOWSPEED did not urge the fans to calm down and behave but just left the situation getting worsen. Indeed, this may be an exceptional case of being famous, but being infamous is definitely not a success in my perspective. You can view it is a success in being infamous, at least he is well-known for his act in Hong Kong.

As can be seen, the notions of success and failure among young people have been different to the society's. This generation is emphasising the importance of being famous while I don't really agree using fame as the only indicator of success. There are a variety of aspects in defining success. It shouldn't be defined as a particular kind as the life path differs in each of us.
